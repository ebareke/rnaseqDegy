Description: Provides a fully automated, command-line friendly bulk RNA-seq
    pipeline for human and mouse data, starting from a raw count matrix and
    a sample design table. The package performs count filtering, QC (PCA with
    optional batch correction, sample correlations, top variable-gene heatmaps),
    differential expression using DESeq2 or edgeR, generation of enhanced
    volcano plots, and functional enrichment via over-representation analysis
    (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using user-supplied GMT
    files. All plots are auto-dimensioned with publication-ready defaults.
